# MF4:SPIC License Iteration and Forking Guidelines

The MF4:SPIC License evolves through iteration and forking, driven by human-AI collaboration.

## Iteration Guidelines
- **When**: Refine terms or adapt the license.
- **Process**:
  1. Define a RAG with updates.
  2. Generate a new license with AI, using the timestamp when generation starts (e.g., 1741720000 (2025)).
  3. Update `LICENSE.md`, archiving the original (1741713600 (2025)) in history.
- **Format**: “MF4:SPIC License (Version [Timestamp] ([Year]))”
- **Example**: 
# MF4:SPIC License (Version 1741720000 (2025))
  
  Copyright (c) [Your Name] @ Unix Timestamp 1741720000 (2025)
  
  Crafted with MF4:SPIC by [Your Name] and Grok 3 (xAI) at Unix Timestamp 1741720000 (2025)


## Forking Guidelines
- **When**: Create a variant for a new purpose.
- **Process**:
1. Copy Version 1741713600 (2025).
2. Add your copyright with the new timestamp/year when your AI starts generating (e.g., 1741730000 (2025)).
3. Reference the original: “Based on Version 1741713600 (2025) by [Your Name].”
4. Save as `LICENSE-FORK-[Timestamp].md` or in a new repo.
- **Format**:

MF4:SPIC License (Version [Fork-Timestamp] ([Year]))
  Copyright (c) [Your Name] @ Unix Timestamp 1741713600 (2025) (Original)
  Copyright (c) [Forker’s Name] @ Unix Timestamp [Fork-Timestamp] ([Year])
  Based on Version 1741713600 (2025) by [Your Name]

- **Example**:

MF4:SPIC License (Version 1741730000 (2025))
  Copyright (c) [Your Name] @ Unix Timestamp 1741713600 (2025) (Original)
  Copyright (c) [Forker’s Name] @ Unix Timestamp 1741730000 (2025)
  Based on Version 1741713600 (2025) by [Your Name]
  Crafted with MF4:SPIC by [Forker’s Name] and [AI Name] at Unix Timestamp 1741730000 (2025)


## Recommendations
- **Timestamp**: Record when AI begins generation (e.g., `date +%s` gives 1741713600 at 15:00:00 UTC).
- **AI Details**: Specify the AI (e.g., Grok 3 by xAI) in the crafting note.
- **Tracking**: Log updates in `CHANGELOG.md` (e.g., “Iterated to 1741720000 (2025): Added clarity”).
